I was trying to integrate the math & more complex calculations from the PlayerMovement reference with the state machine structure that I referenced but was getting stuck, since I was getting confused from how redundant the PlayerMovement reference is, and also not understanding the math well enough.

I wish I had more time to work on it but I spent most of this month researching / working on this without much luck. I can definitely help on some of the simpler stuff that I'm more familiar with before the semester starts (like trigger stuff) but I'm thankful for the opportunity you gave me to work on this. Even if I didn't produce anything usable I still learned a lot.
